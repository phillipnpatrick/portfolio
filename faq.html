              I decided to become a web developer because I enjoy the intellectual stimulation that coding provides. I enjoy writing code, debugging, fixing problems, and constantly challenging myself. I also enjoy working with computers because they do what you tell them to do. Even if it is not what you really intended; however, there is a way to fix your instructions and to bend the computer to your will.

              I decided to become a math teacher because I wanted to influence the next generation. My high school math teacher inspired me to love math and I wanted the opportunity to do the same. I enjoy math because I like the fine attention to details, the fact that there is a definite answer (usually), and that math is logical.

              I have been playing the piano since 1982. I have a Bachelor of Music with a concentration in piano performance. While studying piano, I developed a love for classical music. I most enjoy the Romantic era and some of my favorite composers are Frederic Chopin and Sergei Rachmaninoff. I also enjoy Beethoven, Mozart, Scarlatti, and Bach.
              When I'm not playing classical music, I enjoy playing traditional Christmas music as well as music by popular artists.

              I spent four years working as a consultant for the United States Navy at Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC). While on this government contract, I was responsible for debugging code that required a security clearance. Some of the code was written in a structured programming language (CMS-2), and some was written in object-oriented languages (Ada, C++, Java).
              After CSC, I spent about 8 years working as a consultant for a Microsoft Gold Partner where the main focus was SharePoint development. As a consultant, I worked for several different companies developing customized solutions to business requirements within SharePoint environments. This included creating custom workflows, custom web parts, custom web pages, as well as InfoPath forms. These custom solutions where written in C#.

              Teaching is filled with extreme highs and extreme lows. Teaching requires an extreme amount of flexibility in maintaining control of 30-some students at a time, delivering a pre-planned lesson, thinking on your feet when students don't understand, disciplining students appropriately, communicating with parents, communicating with administration, grading papers, creating assessments, creating new lessons, make-up work, and tutoring outside of class time. Teaching is much more that and 8 to 3:30 job with summers off. It is an exhausting profession. It is an underpaid profession. It is often a thankless job.
